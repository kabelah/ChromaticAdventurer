About This Project

This project was originally developed as part of a university group assignment and has since been migrated from my university GitLab account. Unfortunately, this migration resulted in the loss of commit history from my fellow contributors.

I want to explicitly acknowledge and credit my team members, without whom this project would not have been possible:

Contributors
Name	Email
Casey Walls	c.walls@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl
Rens Gielen	rgj.gielen@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl
Andrei Tutui	a.tutui@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl
Nils Martenson	n.martenson@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl

ðŸ’¡ While this repository is hosted under my account, I do not claim sole authorshipâ€”credit is shared equally with my team members.
